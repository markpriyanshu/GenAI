       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Foreword\\nThe launch of the Global Cooperation Barometer \\ncomes at the start of a crucial year, amid a period \\nof immense geopolitical, geo-economic and market \\nuncertainty, when the bedrock of what was once a \\nstable global system is shifting underfoot. Leaders \\nin the public and private sectors will need to gain \\nfluency in the dynamics driving the changes to not \\njust stabilize their position, but to be equipped to \\nshape a beneficial future.    \\nIt is no secret that the current global context is \\nconcerning, as heightened competition and conflict \\nappear to be replacing cooperation. The result is \\nthat new power dynamics, changing demographic \\nrealities and breakthrough frontier technologies are \\nraising the temperature on long-simmering distrust \\nrather than fueling opportunities for benefit. Many \\nbusinesses are responding to these complicated – \\nand often fraught – geopolitical developments by \\nshifting operations and facilities closer to home. \\nYet, although the world is heading towards a \\ndangerous divide by some measures, elsewhere \\nthere are prospects for and progress on cooperative \\narrangements. For instance, for the first time since \\ncountries began meeting to address global warming, \\nan agreement was reached at the COP28 climate \\nchange conference on transitioning away from   \\nfossil fuels.\\nThat cooperation and confrontation can coexist \\nshould not come as a surprise. History is replete \\nwith parties at odds with one another, but still seeking opportunities for collaboration. Notably, \\nat the height of the Cold War, the United States \\nand the Soviet Union coordinated on eradicating \\nsmallpox and addressing the ozone layer in the \\natmosphere. And many companies that compete \\nwith one another also find ways to cooperate in \\nareas of mutual benefit. \\nIt is within today’s complex geopolitical context that \\ngaining an understanding of the shape of global \\ncooperation – and competition – is vital. Leaders \\nin business and government will need to recognize \\nwhere the contours of opposition end and those \\nof alignment begin to navigate through the \\ngeopolitical turbulence and also to shape a more \\ncooperative future. \\nIt is for this reason that the World Economic \\nForum and McKinsey & Company developed the \\nGlobal Cooperation Barometer. The purpose of \\nthis analysis, which uses 42 indicators to measure \\nthe state of global cooperation broadly and along \\nfive areas, is to help stakeholders in business and \\ngovernment gain a better understanding of the \\nnature of cooperation that is, or is not, taking place.\\nOur hope is that the Global Cooperation Barometer \\nwill offer stakeholders a tool to use in shaping a \\nhealthier, more prosperous and more sustainable \\nworld in the year ahead and beyond.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='The Global Cooperation Barometer is structured \\nalong five dimensions of global connection: trade and \\ncapital, innovation and technology, climate and natural \\ncapital, health and wellness, and peace and security.  \\nThese five pillars were chosen because of their \\nimpact on global development and their explicit \\ndependence on cooperative efforts among nations \\nand economies. As a guiding element in the \\nanalysis, the barometer identified goals that actors \\nare working toward in each of these themes. In \\ndoing so, the barometer draws inspiration from the \\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals and \\nthe efforts of other global institutions.\\nTo quantify change in these pillars, 42 indicators \\nwere identified that research suggests are either \\ncooperative actions that advance progress on \\nthe goals of the pillars or demonstrate a broad \\noutcome from those actions. Cooperative action \\nmetrics measure actions that provide evidence of \\ncooperation; these indicators (such as flows of goods \\nand exchange of intellectual property) are evidence of real, manifested cooperation and do not include “on \\npaper” commitments. Outcome metrics (such as life \\nexpectancy) measure the progress of cooperation, \\nbut typically are influenced by additional factors \\nbeyond just cooperation. The metrics span countries \\nin all geographies and all levels of development. \\nThe barometer looks back at the last 11 years, \\nfrom 2012 through 2022 to establish a trend line \\nof cooperation. It indexes data to 2020 for the \\nfollowing reason: as the COVID-19 pandemic took \\nhold, it accelerated many trends existing in business \\nand society and set in motion many new ones. \\nIndexing the time series to 2020 allows us to see \\nwhat trends were in place before the pandemic, and \\nthe trends that emerged from it (without influencing \\nor distorting the trends themselves). Note that some \\nmetrics have been inverted such that any increase \\nrepresents a positive development. \\nThe methodology used for the Global Cooperation \\nBarometer is outlined below. Details on sourcing of \\nindividual metrics are in the Appendix.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Data coverage\\n1. Geography\\nAcross all metrics, the barometer aims to \\ncollect global data. In most cases, an aggregate \\nglobal weighted average is available. When a \\nglobal weighted average is not available, the \\nmost comprehensive data is used (e.g. OECD \\ncountries, or a sample set of countries where \\ndata is available for all years). \\n2. Years\\nWhile the barometer measures cooperation from \\n2012 through 2022, a few metrics do not have \\ndata for all years. All metrics have 2020 data to \\nensure the indexed trendline can be calculated. \\nIndex calculation\\nTo evaluate global cooperation fairly and compare \\ntrendlines of the action and outcome metrics across \\nthe five pillars, the global cooperation barometer \\napplies the following methodology:1. Indexed trendlines\\nData from 2020 serves as the base year to develop \\ncomparable trendlines, with all values in 2020 equal \\nto 1 (2020=1). This base-year standardization is the \\nbasis of the score calculation, enabling a uniform \\nreference point for all metrics and comparability, \\ndespite different units and datasets. \\n2. Data normalization\\nWhere possible, metrics are normalized to ensure \\nthat trendlines can be assessed independently of the \\neffects of economic growth or population changes. \\nFor example, trade, capital, and other financial \\nflows are normalized to global GDP , while migration \\nmetrics are normalized to global population levels.\\n3. Weighting\\nEach pillar comprises two indices: an action index \\nand an outcome index. To arrive at each, the \\nmetrics within are weighted equally (i.e. the action \\nindex is a simple average of metrics measuring \\ncooperative actions). The overall index for a pillar is \\ncalculated as an average of the action and outcome \\nmetrics. Aggregate indices across pillars are also \\ncalculated as a simple average of pillar indices (i.e. \\nequal weighting across pillars).\\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024\\n5'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Executive summary\\nThe world is facing complex challenges. Addressing \\nthem demands cooperation at the global level. \\nToday’s economy is in a fragile state, with growth \\nexpected to be well below the historical average, \\naccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).1 \\nRevitalizing trade will be crucial to strengthening the \\neconomic outlook ahead and boosting livelihoods. \\nHowever, the IMF has raised alarms about the \\npossibility of global fragmentation, which could \\nshave off 7% of global GDP .2\\nSimilarly, technological innovation is key to \\nboosting currently sluggish productivity growth, \\nwith generative artificial intelligence (AI) holding \\nextraordinary potential – $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion \\nin additional annual value across industries, as \\nestimated by the McKinsey Global Institute.3 The only \\nway to unlock this benefit and manage undesirable \\nconsequences is through global coordination. \\nClimate change requires governments and \\nbusinesses to work together to reach net zero, \\nadapt to shifts in climate already locked in by \\nprevious emissions, and do all of this in a way that \\nsupports economic development across the globe. \\nJust like the health of the planet, the health of people \\nrequires cooperation globally between governments \\nand businesses. Long-term advancements in \\nhealth and immediate responses to acute crises \\nlike pandemics require parties around the world to \\nwork together. Yet, in terms of addressing the health \\nand well-being of people and the planet, the world \\nappears off course, with just 15% of the Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals on track.4 \\nYet, as cooperation is becoming an imperative, the \\nworld order appears to be fragmenting. Indeed, \\nthe global security landscape – once a largely \\ncooperative domain in the post-Cold War era – is \\ndeteriorating, with the United Nations noting at the \\nstart of 2023 that the world was witnessing the \\nhighest number of violent conflicts since World  \\nWar II.5 \\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 presents \\nan approach to measure the current state of global \\ncooperation. In doing so, the report is meant to \\nserve as a tool for leaders to better understand \\nthe contours of cooperation broadly and along five \\npillars – trade and capital flows, innovation and \\ntechnology, climate and natural capital, health and \\nwellness, and peace and security.  After trending positively for much of the past \\ndecade, global cooperation risks moving into \\nreverse. The story varies by pillar:\\n –Trade and capital: trade and capital cooperation \\ngrew through the pandemic disruption, but \\nslowed in 2023; geopolitical tensions and new \\nrestrictions make the future path unclear.\\n –Innovation and technology: flows of data, IP \\nand international students powered an increase \\nin cooperation until 2020, but new questions \\nhave arisen about how to work together to \\nharness opportunities.\\n –Climate and natural capital: the level of \\ncooperation for climate and natural capital has \\nbeen rising steadily, due in large measure to an \\nincrease in commitments, but emissions also \\ncontinue to rise.\\n –Health and wellness: cooperation in health \\nand wellness rose swiftly in response to the \\npandemic, but appears to be settling back to \\nhistorical patterns.\\n –Peace and security: cooperation in peace \\nand security has declined since 2016 and \\nplummeted recently.\\nBecause it is unlikely that the current geopolitical  \\nclimate will change and competition and \\nconfrontation will soon cool, the barometer \\nsuggests that leaders in business and government \\nshould reimagine cooperation. \\nThe barometer shows that cooperation is \\nmultifaceted, and elements of cooperation can \\ncoexist with elements of rivalry. Leaders can \\npractice “coopetition” – balancing cooperation \\nand competition – to advance shared interests in \\nspecific areas, despite lack of alignment elsewhere. \\nFurther, leaders can use these instances of \\ncooperation to build mutual trust, which in turn \\ncould strengthen cooperation in other areas. \\nFundamentally, companies and countries should \\nremember that cooperation breeds strength and \\nresilience. Those that thoughtfully and constructively \\nmanage relationships bounce back better from \\nchallenges and achieve objectives.6Cooperation is multifaceted and can \\ncoexist with competition.\\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024\\n6'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Introduction  \\nThe state of global \\ncooperation\\nThe world is facing a plethora of challenges \\nthat require global cooperation to solve. Global \\ntemperatures shattered previous highs and last year \\nwas the hottest on record.7 And, over 114 million \\npeople have been forcibly displaced worldwide – \\nthe highest level ever.8 At the same time, ongoing \\nthreats of a pandemic and the risks of new, \\nunregulated technologies warrant concern.\\nCooperation is not only necessary as a reactive \\nmechanism to address threatening global \\ndevelopments, but it is also needed to unlock \\nnew opportunities. Indeed, generative AI has \\nthe potential to contribute as much as $2.6 \\ntrillion to $4.4 trillion to the global economy, but \\nrequires substantial coordination across the global \\necosystem to mitigate risks and ensure benefits are \\nshared widely.9 \\nRecent history has shown that global cooperation \\ncan deliver profound benefits. During the first \\nquarter-century after the end of the Cold War – \\na period largely seen as a high point for global \\ncooperation – expanded trade lifted global incomes \\nand as a result, the number of people living in \\nextreme poverty was cut in half.10 Instances of the \\ninternational community reflexively coming together \\nduring this period are most evident through security \\ncoordination in the aftermath of the September 11, \\n2001 attacks, financial coordination in the wake of \\nthe global financial crisis in 2008, which included \\nupgrading the G20, and global commitments to \\naddress the growing danger of climate change \\nthrough the 2015 signing of the Paris Climate \\nAgreement.\\nBy many accounts, the geopolitical dial turned from \\ncooperation to competition in the mid-2010s, as \\nnationalist forces increased in many countries and \\nprotectionist policies rose.11 The dial then turned \\nfurther away from cooperation as conflict broke \\nout in Europe, Africa and the Middle East in recent \\nyears, with the UN warning in early 2023 that the \\nworld was witnessing the highest level of violent \\nconflict since World War II.12 Despite the challenging context, the story about \\nglobal cooperation is not black and white. \\nCountries and companies can compete while also \\ncooperating. Competition, and even confrontation, \\ncan spike in one area while cooperation can deepen \\nin others. In a notable example, in 2022, amid \\nheightened tensions between the United States \\nand China, as climate negotiations between both \\ncountries were suspended and talk of decoupling \\ndominated airwaves, bilateral trade reached record \\nlevels.13 \\nTo help develop a better understanding of the \\ncurrent state of global cooperation, this report \\npresents the Global Cooperation Barometer – a \\ntool that examines cooperation in five pillars: trade \\nand capital, innovation and technology, climate \\nand natural capital, health and wellness, and peace \\nand security. The five pillars were chosen because, \\ngiven the interconnected nature of the world, \\ncooperation at the global level is necessary to see \\nadvancements in each of these areas. \\nOverall, the barometer indicates that after trending \\npositively for much of the past decade, global \\ncooperation has been mildly reversing (down \\n2%) since 2020 (Figure 1). The period from \\n2012 to the pandemic was marked by increased \\ncooperation across four of the five pillars (peace \\nand security was the exception), led by innovation \\nand technology’s more than 30% increase in \\ncooperation (Figure 2). However, in more recent \\nyears new questions have arisen about how to  \\nwork together to harness opportunities that arise \\nfrom innovation.Measuring cooperation is a critical step in  \\nidentifying ways to strengthening it. \\n Overall, the \\nbarometer \\nindicates that \\nafter trending \\npositively for much \\nof the past decade, \\nglobal cooperation \\nhas been mildly \\nreversing (down \\n2%) since 2020.\\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024\\n7'),\n",

Globally, FDI stock rose from 30% \\nin 2012 to 49% in 2020, as a share of GDP . \\nTrade presents a more mixed story in this period. \\nServices flows (as a percentage of GDP) rose \\nsteadily between 2012-2019, when a collapse in \\ntravel triggered a fall in services from 13.7% of GDP \\nin 2019 to 11.8% in 2020. Goods flows declined \\nfrom 49.3% of GDP in 2012 to 41.9% in 2020.   \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the years that \\nfollowed shook up trade and capital flows. Despite \\nthis, there has been a continued net increase, \\nthough it has been moderate. Trade flows fell \\nin the immediate wake of quarantines and then \\nrebounded strongly. At the onset of the pandemic, \\nconsumer demand decreased sharply and some \\nproduction and shipping ground to a halt. Yet, trade \\nsoon rebounded as homebound consumers started \\nspending more on goods. Countries remained \\ninterconnected and cooperative out of necessity as \\nthe world navigated a once-in-a-century event and \\nthis pattern persisted through 2022. For example, \\nfrom 2021 to 2022, the flow of goods as a share of \\nGDP increased by 10%, reaching a historical peak \\nat 51% of GDP (up from 46.7% in 2021).\\nAs for capital flows, they normalized after an initial \\nspike in 2020 (for FDI) and 2021 (for foreign portfolio \\ninvestment).14 As COVID-19 surged, flows of capital \\nincreased as banks reallocated liquidity around the world and more multinationals relied on financing \\nto navigate the disruption. After this initial surge, \\nhowever, capital flows normalized.

For example, the United \\nStates has been trading more with Mexico and \\nViet Nam, and China has increased trade and \\ninvestment across South-East Asia.\\nThese trends could improve opportunities for global \\nparticipation in trade and capital flows. Today, \\nthere is great disparity in global integration – some \\nsmaller European and Asian city-state economies \\nare among the most integrated, while many \\nemerging nations show low levels of trade relative \\nto their size.

      "just stabilize their position, but to be equipped to \n",
      "shape a beneficial future.    \n",
      "It is no secret that the current global context is\n",
      "concerning, as heightened competition and conflict \n",
      "appear to be replacing cooperation. The result is \n",
      "that new power dynamics, changing demographic\n",
      "realities and breakthrough frontier technologies are \n",
      "raising the temperature on long-simmering distrust \n",
      "rather than fueling opportunities for benefit. Many\n",
      "businesses are responding to these complicated – \n",
      "and often fraught – geopolitical developments by \n",
      "shifting operations and facilities closer to home. \n",
      "Yet, although the world is heading towards a\n",
      "dangerous divide by some measures, elsewhere \n",
      "there are prospects for and progress on cooperative \n",
      "arrangements. For instance, for the first time since\n",
